# Image Segmentation

Object detection builds a bounding box for each detected object in the image, but it tells us nothing about the shape of the object. We only get the set of bounding box coordinates.

Instead, Image Segmentation is a technique that creates a pixel-wise mask for each detected object in the image and so can help us to obtain a far more granular understanding of the objects in the image.
